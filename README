I spoke with Professor Rene in his office hours because I needed help bug 
fixing my Model and Translator class as well as just making sure my mind was in
the right direction in regards to how I thought to program this assignment.

I used ChatGPT in the beginning of my work to bug fix when it came to inserting
a character into a string and how to convert a character into a string variable.

I also referenced some of Rene's CPSC 298 videos when going over inFile and outFile
in my File Processor class.
